# STICK HERO : AP PROJECT

## Dependancy:
1. Change the path in the GamePageController line 281, please put the actual path, ot the relative path.
2. The path can be found under src->main->resources->application.stickhero->assets->cherry2.png

## How to play:
1. Stick increases by pressing and hosting the space bar
2. The hero inverts to get cherries by pressing the down arrow button. It stays inverted for as long as the button is pressed, it comes back to its normal state when down arrow button is released.
